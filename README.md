# Rental-Bike-Price-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting bike rental demand using an ensemble learning approach. By utilizing the Bike Sharing Dataset (day.csv), we transformed the problem into a binary classification taskâ€”determining whether daily rental demand is high or low based on various environmental and temporal features. An ensemble model was built using a Voting Classifier that combines Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Gradient Boosting classifiers. The model achieved an impressive accuracy of 92.52%, demonstrating the effectiveness of ensemble techniques in improving prediction robustness and performance. Key features influencing demand included temperature, humidity, and seasonal indicators. The project also includes visualizations such as confusion matrix and feature importance plots to aid in model interpretation. This work highlights the potential of machine learning in supporting data-driven decision-making for urban mobility and transportation planning.
